# Application using Gemini API

This project is part of Artificial Intelligence with Gemini Alura + Google immersion.

We can build chatbots and create a system to make document retrievals, using Gemini API. There are many possibilities and applications that can be created using this AI.

This project is a system that makes searches related to Fairy Tales. 
You can ask the AI to translate the tales, to sum them up, ask questions regarding the stories. This is nice if you are learning a new language, it is good to turn the text simpler to understand for children and there are so many different possibilities, including testing text interpretation in schools.

## How to Use

### Requirements:

You need to have the Docker installed on your machine and create your API key to execute the code.

### Running the code

Execute: `make run`. The docker image will be built and after that, the container will executed. On your terminal, it will appear a link, that you should click and then the Jupyterlab interface will open inside your browser.
That's it!

You can create other notebooks there or play around with `search_in_docs.ipynb`.
